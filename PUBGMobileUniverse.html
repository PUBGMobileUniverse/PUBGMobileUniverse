            <h2>What is PUBG Mobile</h2>
            <p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed
                 and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole.
                 The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for 
                 other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone 
                 game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto 
                 an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed 
                 themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing 
                 surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing 
                 wins the round.</p>
